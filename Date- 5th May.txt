## **Slide 9: Standardization and Customization Consideration**

- **Client Perspective on Standardization:**  
  - **Custom vs. Standard:** Initially, clients might expect customized solutions; however, a standardized “Golden Image” can provide faster turnarounds  
  - **Value for Small/Emerging Pharma:** Standardization can be a game changer by expediting rollouts without sacrificing critical insights

- **Balancing the Two:**  
  - Clearly communicate benefits of standardization while allowing for necessary customization based on unique client needs
