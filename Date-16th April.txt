BI (Business Intelligence) Testing (Session)- Key to improving quality of BI reports, helps in preventing making wrong strategic decision
Complexity:
1. UI part/ Aesthetics Part
2. Data related (Sales data shown wrong/ charts are clumsy)

UI/Aesthetics:
1. Color coding (Green- Growth Up, Red- Down) of products in Trend, Bar Charts, Growth Metrics
2. Color Coding Consistency (for Brands or products across dashboards)
3. Consistency across dashboard to handle null, blank or zero values)
4. Branding and Welcome message
5. Dashboard Headers and Footers consistency
6. Dashboard refresh dates, data weekend dates, calendar, and help icon
7. Font Size and Font Color consistency across dashboard
8. Label Orientations, Legends, and Information

Data Testing:
1. Data Sync across dashboard
2. Checking outliers- check spikes & drops (Natural issue or data related issue)
3. Consistency across dashboard for monthly and weekly trends
4. Data accuracy checks
5. Data Refresh & Update Mechanism
6. Data Aggregation and Calculation Logic
7. Data Filtering and sorting
8. Error handling and messaging
9. Data security and permissions
10. Drill down and drill through accuracy

Functionality Testing:
1. Check Landing Page Availability
2. Verify brand access
3. Pre-caching Functionality (MicroStrategy iPAD specific)
4. Navigation of each dashboard (Back Navigation issue address)
5. Default selectors on dashboard (e.g. time period)
6. Ride along scenarios (Higher geography user impersonating the same geography of rep user)
7. Dashboard Changes wrt Selection of Brand, Time Period or Geography
8. Exports and Custom list Addition, Deletion and Update
9. Search Behavior
10. User Persona Testing (Different User Roles and Hierarchy)
11. Drill-down Data Functionality

Usability Testing:
1. Dashboard Loading Speed
2. Help/FAQ Accessibility
3. Information Overload vs UnderLoad
4. Ease of Navigation
5. Clarity of Labels and Titles
6. Visual Appeal and Consistency
7. Error Feedback and Messaging
8. Responsive and Mobile Compatibility
9. Use Customization Options
10. Consistency in Interactive Elements

Performance Testing

Common Issues in Dashboard-
1. % reach going above 100%

Test Case Prioritization (For Quality Engineering Teams)- Managing limited resources like Time and Computational Power- To focus on the most impactful tests, helping to maximize test coverage while reducing 
1. Risk Based Prioritization
2. Coverage Based Prioritization
3. Requirements Based Prioritization
4. History Based
5. Change Request Based
6. Customer Focused Areas (Business Impact and User Priority)
7. Re-Prioritization of Test Cases
8. Best Practice: Post-Code Change Testing

Test Data Selection:


Call Plan KT Session:

Power BI session:
Scorecard (Final payment given to the rep)- weekly based report
Templates are set, can't be personalized
No Insights available
High cost
Slow loading Time (for large data set)
No in build filtering option (querry to be added for each filtering operation)
